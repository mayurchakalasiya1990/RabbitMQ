As an administrator, start and stop the server as usual for Debian-based systems:

# stop the local node
>>sudo service rabbitmq-server stop

# start it back
>>ssudo service rabbitmq-server start

# check on service status as observed by service manager
>>sudo service rabbitmq-server status

# checks if the local node is running and CLI tools can successfully authenticate with it
>>sudo rabbitmq-diagnostics ping

# prints enabled components (applications), TCP listeners, memory usage breakdown, alarms
# and so on
>>sudo rabbitmq-diagnostics status

# prints effective node configuration
>>sudo rabbitmq-diagnostics environment

# performs a more extensive health check of the local node
>>sudo rabbitmq-diagnostics node_health_check


#system service logs can be inspected using

>>sudo journalctl --system | grep rabbitmq

#it must be enabled before it can be used. That's done using rabbitmq-plugins:
cd /usr/sbin
sudo rabbitmq-plugins enable rabbitmq_management
